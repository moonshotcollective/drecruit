# dRecruit

A decentralized recruiting platform built by the Moonshot Collective!

# Why we built this

Current recruiting sites like LinkedIn and Indeed often use candidates resumé data to build algrothims and sell information to recruiters. This is highly unethical, and candidates do not receive any compensation for the information they provide to recruiters. dRecruit offers a solution: Candidates get paid every time a recruiter accesses their data, and dRecruit does not use the information in unethical ways.
